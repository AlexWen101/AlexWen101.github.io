Hi! Iâ€™m an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia majoring in both physics and math. In my work, I mostly do particle and nuclear physics, along with some computing and machine learning.

You might also find me being a: 20th-century history buff, competitive table tennis player, or amateur hiker/skiier/kayaker (depending on time of year).
