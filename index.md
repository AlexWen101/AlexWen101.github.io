Hi there. Iâ€™m an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia (2017-2022) studying physics and math.

I currently work on plasma stability research at <a href="https://generalfusion.com/" target="_blank">General Fusion</a> to help build a commercially-viable nuclear fusion reactor.

<details>
  <summary>More research, personal details</summary>

  Outside of my current work with plasma physics, I have experience in mostly nuclear and particle physics. However, I'm broadly interested in any type of fundamental physics, especially on the theory side.

  I frequently work with machine learning and heavy-duty computation as research tools.

 ## Research Projects

 ### Plasma Stability at General Fusion

  General Fusion's approach is to first inject a plasma into a cavity surrounded by liquid metal; this cavity is then collapsed using pistons, which squeezes and heats the plasma and induces fusion reactions.

  With Aaron Froese and the simulations team, I'm using computational models to optimize the characteristics of a hot plasma that is being compressed. We want to make sure, when we subject plasma to increased temperatures and densities for fusion to take place, that it will remain stable and behave in a useful way.


  ### ATLAS Data Analysis

  I spent around 6 months working on the <a href="https://atlas.cern/" target="_blank">ATLAS experiment</a>, a large particle collider experiment at CERN.

  Most recently, with Pierre Savard and Lukas Adamek at the University of Toronto, we developed ways to estimate and quantify the measurement uncertainty of the Higgs boson mass, an important parameter of interest that ATLAS observes.

  <center><i>The uncertainty of the Higgs mass is related to how wide the Higgs mass distribution (light blue) appears on a histogram of many different particle masses.

  Before that, with Alison Lister and Colin Gay at my home university, we developed machine learning methods to distinguish a specific kind of quark (top) decay from large quantities of background data.

  ### LHCb Statistics

  For half a summer at Imperial College London, I worked with William Barter on the <a href="http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">LHCb experiment</a>, also located at CERN. We used and developed statistical methods to see if the differences between two samples of particle decay data are statistically significant. Such methods are useful for seeing how matter and antimatter behave differently, a central problem in physics.

  ### NEWS-G Dark Matter Search at SNOLAB

  For a summer at <a href="https://www.snolab.ca/" target="_blank">SNOLAB</a>, with Pierre Gorel, I worked on simulations of a new dark matter detector called <a href="https://news-g.org/" target="_blank">NEWS-G</a>. We were interested in seeing the effects of a neutron radiation calibration source on the detector performance, and investigated signal processing options to discriminate between dark matter and other signals.

  <center><i>NEWS-G is a big sphere with electrodes and filled with gas, making it a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_counter" target="_blank">proportional counter</a> that's sensitive to many signals, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles " target="_blank">WIMP</a> dark matter candidates. It's shielded by lead and plastic from background radiation. </i></center>

  ### Commissioning the EMMA Spectrometer at TRIUMF

  EMMA is a recoil mass spectrometer at <a href="https://www.triumf.ca/" target="_blank">TRIUMF</a>, Canada's national lab for accelerator physics. At EMMA, after an energetic particle beam is collided into a target, the resulting nuclei (recoils) are sorted and classified based on their mass and charge. It allows us to study a lot of different nuclear reactions, especially astrophysical ones.  

  I worked with EMMA's principal researcher, Barry Davids, for one summer on running simulations and gauging EMMA's operating characteristics. I usually work part-time with the EMMA group during the school year.

  ## Personal Background

  I grew up and live in Vancouver, Canada.

  <center><img src="{{ site.github.url }}/assets/img/intro/van-pic.jpg" alt="van" width="450"/></center>

  I'm an amateur but avid backpacker, hiker, and skiier, depending on the time of year. I'm in the process of fully exploring the many provincial and national parks from Vancouver to the Rockies. I used to be a competitive table tennis player, and I still play every so often.

  Academically, I love learning about military history - I'm pursuing a history minor degree. I also enjoy learning about tanks and aircraft and associated technologies (probably a product of my childhood interest, which never quite evaporated...).
