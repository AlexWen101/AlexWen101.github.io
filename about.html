            <h2 id="the-1-minute-version">The 1-minute Version</h2>
<p>I’m currently an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia majoring in both physics and math.</p>
<p>I have experience in nuclear, astroparticle, and high-energy physics research, and have related skills in programming, statistics, and technical problem-solving.</p>
<p>I plan to go to graduate school for physics or a related field and would like to eventually work in academia.</p>
<p>Here’s my CV. If the link works, it’s the most up-to-date version.</p>
<p>   </p>
<h2 id="if-you-have-a-few-more-minutes">If you have a few more minutes…</h2>
<p>I helped build and test the Geant4 physics simulations for two experiments, EMMA at TRIUMF and NEWS-G at SNOLAB. The former is a nuclear mass spectrometer designed to study products of energetic nuclear reactions. The latter is a direct-detection dark matter detector.</p>
<p>More recently, I worked on optimizing performance of a hybrid tree-sequence neural network used for identifying top quark decays in the ATLAS detector, which is based at CERN.</p>
<p>Most recently, I investigated the performance of a statistical test used for identifying CP violation in data acquired by the LHCb detector, also based at CERN.</p>
<p>I’m very passionate about science outreach and value the importance of good teaching.</p>
<p>Outside of physics, I enjoy learning about military history, military technology (especially tanks and planes), politics, and religion.</p>
<p>I debate competitively.</p>
<p>I play table tennis competitively. I often go skiing, hiking, trail running, and kayaking.</p>
