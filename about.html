<p>Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia majoring in both physics and math.</p>
<p>I have experience in nuclear, astroparticle, and high-energy physics research, and have related skills in programming, statistics, and technical problem-solving.</p>
<p>I plan to go to graduate school for physics or a related field and would like to eventually work in academia.</p>
<p>Outside of physics, I enjoy learning about military history, military technology (especially tanks and aircraft), politics, and religion.</p>
<p>I enjoy public speaking, and I debate competitively.</p>
<p>I play table tennis competitively. I often go skiing, hiking, trail running, and kayaking.</p>
